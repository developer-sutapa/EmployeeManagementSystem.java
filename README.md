## 📌 Overview

The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a simple application that helps organizations manage employee records efficiently. It allows adding, updating, deleting, and viewing employee details such as ID, name, department, salary, and more.

This project demonstrates the use of **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles** such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, along with data structures and file handling.
